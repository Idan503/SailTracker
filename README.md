# SailTracker
Sailing club membership manager and tracker application.  
Club members can sign in using their phone numbers,  
and view the realtime-updating sailing club schedule, which is shared among all users.  
Members can register for events, stay tuned for new events, and upload photos from sails.  
  
On the other hand, by using SailTracker,  
the sailing club managers will be able to readily add new events to the schedule,  
or delete existing events in the app itself, instead of sending emails/sms to all the club members.
